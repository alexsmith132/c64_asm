                          --- change log ---


This text only contains descriptions of changes independent of the
platform used. There should be another help file in this archive
outlining the platform specific changes.




***   Changes from release 0.84 alpha to release 0.85 alpha:

Fixed bug: Handling of parentheses in new expression parser was badly
    screwed up. Thanks go to Nathan Smith for reporting that bug.
Verbosity messages for segments and output file now contain size info.




***   Changes from release 0.08 beta to release 0.84 alpha:

Some changes in documentation (mainly corrected typos)
Usage count for labels (Unused ones are marked in label dump file)
New PO: "!8" (for 8-bit values, as "!byte" / "!by" / "!08")
Finally removed the dreaded only-two-input-files restriction
Improved PO: "!to" has parameter for choosing output file format
Fixed bug: Blanks after "!for"'s "}" character stopped assembly
Rewritten expression parser and label tree handler (should be faster)
Generally tidied up the source.
Skipped some version numbers to get a "less frightening" one. :)




***   Changes from release 0.07 beta to release 0.08 beta:

Fixed really serious bug: The 65816's indirect DP addressing caused
    wrong opcodes to be generated. Thanks to Doc Bacardi/The Dreams
    for reporting it.




***   Changes from release 0.05 beta to release 0.07 beta:

Fixed really serious bug: Indirect JMP / JSR were assembled without
    target addresses. Thanks to YTM/Alliance for reporting that one.
Fixed bug in value parser's handling of parentheses: Expressions like
    "a*(b-c)+d" gave "a*((b-c)+d)", obviously not the same.
Fixed bug: "!set LABEL = VALUE" now *really* works correctly.
Fixed bug: ACME gave "too late for postfix" error when reading a
    predefined label of known size. Only occurred when using macros.
Fixed bug: Error messages given from within macro definitions used
    truncated file names.
Fixed bug: Calling of local macros didn't work at all.
Fixed bug: "}" chars directly after macro calls were not found.
Fixed bug: Spaces after ":" and "{" gave syntax errors.
Fixed bug: Line counting inside loops was screwed up.
Fixed bug: Changed argument order of MVP and MVN (now it's "opcode,
    source, target")
New PO: "!08" (for 8-bit values, as "!byte" / "!by")
New PO: "!16" (for 16-bit values, as "!word" / "!wo")
New PO: "!24" (for 24-bit values)
New PO: "!32" (for *signed* 32-bit values)
New PO: "!pseudopc" (starts offset assembly)
New PO: "!realpc" (ends offset assembly)
New PO: "!for LABEL, TIMES { LINES }" for easier loops.
New PO: "!initmem BYTE" to define empty memory.
New PO: "!endoffile" (short "!eof") replaces "!end".
New PO: "!ifdef" (only use this if you *really* know what you are
    doing. Otherwise, just don't use it)
New PO: "!convtab CONVERSION" (short "!ct") selects the default
    character conversion, making "!cbm" obsolete.
Improved PO: "!binary" now has "skip" parameter.
Change: "!cbm" outputs a warning when used - use "!ct pet" instead.
Change: "!end" no longer works - use "!eof" instead.
Change: "*=VALUE" is now segment change instead of offset assembly.
Change: Argument order of MVN/MVP is now as is standard.
The typecast system has been rewritten - now it works as intended.
BIT without any parameters no longer works - use a macro instead.
Leading zeros are stored in label structures and acted upon.
The documentation is in several files now.
Negative numbers are now handled much more sensibly.
'ACME' environment variable only needed when *really* needed.




***   Changes from release 0.04 beta to release 0.05 beta:

Fixed bug: No more multiple error messages.
Fixed bug: Zone names now work correctly (First char wasn't stored).
Fixed bug: "!set label = label" now works correctly (I hope).
Fixed bug: "stz ...,y" gave "number too big" instead of "illegal
    combination of command and addressing mode"
New PO: "!subzone" (short "!sz") for nested zones.
Added support for library tree when using "!source" or "!binary".
Single-character strings can now be given in single quotes as well.
Real icons.
Startup errors now exit correctly with EXIT_FAILURE code.
Example program now includes "Expected_Output" file.
Further tidied up the sources.
Tidied up the general help file:
 -Changed "Freeware" to "free software"
 -Corrected the information given on "!align".
 -Added examples for most of the pseudo opcodes.




***   Changes from release 0.03 beta to release 0.04 beta:

Corrected some small bugs.
New PO: "!zone" (short "!zn") replaces "!module" (short "!mod")
Tidied up the sources a lot.
Changed bad style C code reported by lint.
Added GNU GPL hint in every source file.
Added startup message in verbose mode.
Added "Error: " to startup error messages.
Added Amiga, Linux and OS/2 versions




***   Changes from release 0.02 alpha to release 0.03 beta:

Generally tidied up the source.
Moved RISC OS-specific CLI options to platform file.
Added pathname conversion from UNIX style to current platform style.
Added context variables (enabling "!source"s and macros).
Translated all documentation to english.
Changed string pseudo opcodes to allow numeric values.
Added verbose mode (CLI option "v").
Added output buffer, removing the need for additional output pass (and
    now the "!to" pseudo opcode can be placed anywhere).
More than one "label = pc" definition per statement now illegal.
Instead added possibility to have several statements on a single line
    by using ":" as a separator character.
Added new keywords: "!set", "!if", "else", "!do", "until", "while" and
    "!macro"
Added support for "!source".
Added basic support for blocks.
Added support for "!if {...} else {...}".
Added support for zone titles.
Added support for loops (endless loops are only detected if producing
    code).
Added support for macros (even nested definitions are possible now).
Added DOS version.




***   Changes from release 0.01 alpha to release 0.02 alpha

Er, I don't know anymore. It was a bad ugly hack and it only ran on
    RISC OS. :-)
