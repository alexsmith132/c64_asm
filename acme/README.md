# ACME Cross Assembler

I played a while around with this cross assembler and am only providing the aged source code for it, 
because I did some stuff with that thing, like the NEO-layout. 

I do prefer working with the "xa" cross assembler or the "cc65" cross c-compiler/assembler/linker. 
But this project has a nice list of addresses for the C64 and other computers in it's library, so I'm including it.

I think this project has evolved over time, but I never found a platform independent or Linux version again, so 
I abandoned this cross-assembler, because there are other projects, that do. But it is good work, just mostly
Windows-only, so it's not for me.
